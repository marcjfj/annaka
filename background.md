## Background

As seasoned and driven healthcare professional with a wide range of unique and applicable skills, I am confident that becoming a nurse is the natural next step of my career. I found my passion and natural aptitude for healing and nurturing those in need years ago, and am strongly motivated to move into the nursing profession. 

My interest in healthcare was spurred at age 17 when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Through frequent hospital visits and my role at home as his caregiver, I was exposed to the challenges and demands of the healthcare industry. I was also inspired by the compassion and selflessness possessed by those who had dedicated their lives to medicine. 

Feeling that the best way to promote wellness was through preventative measures, I completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in mass communications with the goal of becoming an advocate for healthy lifestyles. My deep-rooted interest in health led me to the importance of diet, and I continued my education to become a nutritionist. Though I take great pride in the difference that I made in the lives of my clients, I knew that my true potential would only be realized through formal medical training. After working closely with a nonprofit organization, I was exposed to and developed a deeper understanding of a wide variety of socioeconomic populations. This further inspired me to go back to school to help people more directly as a nurse. 

With the leadership skills that I developed as an accelerated nursing student, William Jewell College prepared me with the critical thinking skills necessary to be an advocate for positive change in the healthcare industry.
