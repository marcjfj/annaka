## Mission Statement

**Vision:** My desire to be a skillful, compassionate, and honest nurse has led me to this point in my life. As a nurse, my hope is to support people on the worst days of their lives and care for them on the best days.  

**Mission Statement:** My open and pleasant disposition is one of my unique traits that I display in every interaction. I value honesty, compassion, caring, and integrity as I believe that medical care should be free of bias and promote the well being of all people.
  
**Personal Philosophy:** As a warm and caring nurse, I will help my patients by bringing my cheerful and loving energy into every room. I hold others and myself to the upmost standards when it comes to honesty and integrity. I will be aware of my actions and honest in my possible mistakes or shortcomings. My compassion will be evident in the way that I care for and treat everyone with the same care and respect that they deserve.
