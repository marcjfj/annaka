Write a brief description of the proposed service activity:
We will go to a nursing home and lead an art project that involves painting hearts. 


Date and time of Service Activity: TBD

 ### Objectives

- **Identify three (3) objectives for this service experience.**

    To bring joy and brightness to the lives of elderly people living in a nursing home and to support those closer to death (ie patients on hospice care). 
    As an emotional outlet, art can be a wonderful way for people to express their emotions and feelings without having to use words. 
    To go out and get involved in the community in a positive way.


- **Identify the target population and discuss the need for the service activity within the target population.**

	The target population is elderly people living in a nursing home facility and specifically 	but not limited to patients receiving hospice care. 


- **Determine the schedule for the day and the expectations of the Agency/Organization.**

    This is yet to be determined with the nursing home.
 

- **Explain how nursing skills and knowledge will be used throughout the service project.**

	Communication amongst staff for organization and the clients for instruction and 	questioning, openness and compassion as we lead an older, less advantaged population 	to express themselves and hopefully have fun doing an art/ painting project.

- **List the number of volunteers needed for this service project and what the expectations are for the volunteers participating.**

    Tori and Meaghan will also be helping/attending this event.
