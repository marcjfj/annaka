As seasoned and driven healthcare professional with a wide range of unique and applicable skills, I am confident that becoming a nurse is the natural next step of my career. I found my passion and natural aptitude for healing and nurturing those in need years ago, and am strongly motivated to move into the nursing profession. My interest in healthcare was spurred at age 17 when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Through frequent hospital visits and my role at home as his caregiver, I was exposed to the challenges and demands of the healthcare industry. I was also inspired by the compassion and selflessness possessed by those who had dedicated their lives to medicine. 

Feeling that the best way to promote wellness was through preventative measures, I completed a bachelor’s degree in mass communications with the goal of becoming an advocate for healthy lifestyles. My deep-rooted interest in health led me to the importance of diet, and I continued my education to become a nutritionist. Though I take great pride in the difference that I made in the lives of my clients, I knew that my true potential would only be realized through formal medical training. After working closely with a nonprofit organization, I was exposed to and developed a deeper understanding of a wide variety of socioeconomic populations. This further inspired me to go back to school to help people more directly as a nurse. With the leadership skills that I developed as an accelerated nursing student, William Jewell College prepared me with the critical thinking skills necessary to be an advocate for positive change in the healthcare industry.

**Vision:** My desire to be a skillful, compassionate, and honest nurse has led me to this point in my life. As a nurse, my hope is to support people on the worst days of their lives and care for them on the best days.  

**Mission Statement:** My open and pleasant disposition is one of my unique traits that I display in every interaction. I value honesty, compassion, caring, and integrity as I believe that medical care should be free of bias and promote the well being of all people.
  
**Personal Philosophy:** As a warm and caring nurse, I will help my patients by bringing my cheerful and loving energy into every room. I hold others and myself to the upmost standards when it comes to honesty and integrity. I will be aware of my actions and honest in my possible mistakes or shortcomings. My compassion will be evident in the way that I care for and treat everyone with the same care and respect that they deserve.

Write a brief description of the proposed service activity:
We will go to a nursing home and lead an art project that involves painting hearts. 


Date and time of Service Activity: TBD

 ### Objectives

- **Identify three (3) objectives for this service experience.**

    To bring joy and brightness to the lives of elderly people living in a nursing home and to support those closer to death (ie patients on hospice care). 
    As an emotional outlet, art can be a wonderful way for people to express their emotions and feelings without having to use words. 
    To go out and get involved in the community in a positive way.


- **Identify the target population and discuss the need for the service activity within the target population.**

	The target population is elderly people living in a nursing home facility and specifically 	but not limited to patients receiving hospice care. 


- **Determine the schedule for the day and the expectations of the Agency/Organization.**

    This is yet to be determined with the nursing home.
 

- **Explain how nursing skills and knowledge will be used throughout the service project.**

	Communication amongst staff for organization and the clients for instruction and 	questioning, openness and compassion as we lead an older, less advantaged population 	to express themselves and hopefully have fun doing an art/ painting project.

- **List the number of volunteers needed for this service project and what the expectations are for the volunteers participating.**

    Tori and Meaghan will also be helping/attending this event.
